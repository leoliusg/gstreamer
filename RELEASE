Release notes for GStreamer 1.11.90

The GStreamer team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the
stable 1.12 release series. The 1.12 release series is adding new features on
top of the 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 1.10 series and is part of the API and
ABI-stable 1.x release series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.


Full release notes will be provided with the 1.12.0 release, highlighting all
the new features, bugfixes, performance optimizations and other important
changes.


Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will be provided in the next days.

For actual media playback, you will need other modules.

gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plugins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
gst-libav
contains a set of codecs plugins based on libav (formerly gst-ffmpeg)
